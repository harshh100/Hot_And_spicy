# HOT & SPICY 

This is an online food ordering system built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The system consists of two main components: the client and the server. jhada

## Client

The client folder contains the front-end part of the application built using React. It includes the user interface and components for the online food ordering system.

### Getting Started

To set up the client-side application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
3. rename `Dot_env_file_format_for_client.txt` to `.env` and set your server url in it.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

## Server

The server folder contains the back-end part of the application built using Node.js and Express.js. It manages the database and handles the requests from the client-side application.

### Getting Started

To set up the server-side application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
3. rename `Dot_env_file_format_for_server.txt` to `.env` and set-up it with your details.
5. Run `node app.js` to start the server.
6. The server will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) by default.

### Database

This system utilizes MongoDB as the database. Make sure to have MongoDB installed and running before starting the server.
